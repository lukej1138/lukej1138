## Heyo!👋 I'm Lucas Johnson.

Hey! I'm Lucas, a CS major concentrating in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University. Currently, I'm a member of Sandbox at Northeastern, where I have the pleasure to develop SearchNEU, a course review website working out of the Next.js framework. While I'm currently working in web development, I also have a strong passion for everything machine learning and AI; on the side, I'm actively working on my personal AI assistant, Jarvis!
